# Aeon - Creating a programming language for fun and definitely not profit

## Philosophy
Aeon is a C, Go, Rust, and Zig inspired language. It takes the aspects I like from all those languages and smashes them together.

Its likely not good, but its for my own leaning. If you find it interesting feel free to try it out once its runnable, currently its not. 

## AI Usage
1. Asking question. i.e. how to do X in Rust.
2. Boring refactors.

No actual logic should ever be written by AI, the defeats the purpose of learning.
